# replicate-flux-commandline-client

installs three commands on the command-line when installed globally through npm i -g.

In lines of code, in strokes of paint,
In whispered dreams, both bold and faint,
Art emerges, wild and free,
A map of all that we might be.

It bends the rules, it breaks the frame,
It has no owner, knows no name.
A canvas spun from thought and heart,
Each breath, each moment, forms its part.

It’s in the flux, the ebb, the flow,
Where chaos meets the things we know.
It’s every shade, both light and dark,
A fleeting spark, a lasting mark.

So let it twist, and let it play,
Let art transform with each new day.
For boundless beauty, raw and true,
Is nothing more than what we do.
